# Building a Distributed System: The Basics

This is a talk I gave at the [Distributed Computing Denver](http://www.meetup.com/Distributed-Computing-Denver/) Meetup on 4-28-2016. The presentation focuses on fundamental principles of distributed computing illustrated by building a very simple distrbuted system from the bottom up.

The presentation uses [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). Please refer to that project for instructions on running the project and exporting to PDF.
